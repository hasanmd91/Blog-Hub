# BlogHub

BlogHub is a event-sharing app that allows users to share their memories and
experiences with others. The app is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,
React, and Node.js) which provides a stable and efficient framework for the app's
development. Users can create posts, add photos, and share their memories
with their friends and family. Additionally, the app has a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for
anyone to use. BlogHub can be a great way to document, preserve and share life events
and memories with others. This app is in a continuous development process. User Authentication will be added soon.
